	<strong>Adding a Course</strong>
</p>
<p>
	&bull; Adding a course to your schedule is easy as pie!
	<br />&bull; Go to the &ldquo;Course Add&rdquo; section. You should see your name and student ID number.
	<br />&bull; If you happen to know the CRN of the course you wish to add, then just enter it here and click the Add Course button.
	<br />&bull; Alas, the above is not usually the norm. More often you will need to look-up the CRN (Course Reference Number) for the course you wish to add.
	<br />&bull; To look-up a course, press the &ldquo;Search Class Schedule&rdquo; button and then scroll down to the bottom of the page.
	<br />&bull; Here you will find filters to restrict your class search. Only the Term filter is required, but please note that results are limited to the first 200 classes found, so be as specific as possible.
	<br />&bull; Once you have chosen your filter, then press the &ldquo;Class Search&rdquo; button to load the results of the search.
	<br />&bull; Find the class you wish to add and then click on the corresponding checkbox on the left. This will then close this section and the Class Schedule Search section and the chosen course will appear in the Preregistration Choices section above.<br />&bull; All added courses will default to 0 points, and a G grading track.

	<strong>Course Point Allocation</strong>
</p>
<p>
	&bull; After adding a course, then you can change the number of points you wish to allocate to that course.
	<br />&bull; Point allocation should reflect your course priority (higher points = stronger priority).
	<br />&bull; Use the course's corresponding input box under the Points column to change your course point allocations.
	<br />&bull; The points allocated cannot exceed the number of points permitted for the term.
	<br />&bull; Each course must have at least one point allocated.
